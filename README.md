# CommonLibraries
A collection of static libraries used as a backbone for rapid interactive application development

The projects could be loaded into Visual Studio through the CommonLibraries.sln
The project ObjFile will not compile without tinyobjloader third party library (could be found on GitHub)
If a project needs to derive from one of the static libraries then you will need to add the corresponding propery page
